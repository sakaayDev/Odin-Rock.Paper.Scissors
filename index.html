  <h1>what do i need?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>i need 2 players ME(or someone else) and the computer</li>
    <br>
    <li>1-the computer must make a random choice between R/P/S so 3 choice 2-so will i using a prompt probably </li>
    <br>
    <li>need to set up win and lose condition rock>scissors>paper>rock</li>
    <br>
    <li>display message you won/lost  </li>
    <br>
    <li>i said 2 player so probably 2 variable,i wonder if i need variable for rock,paper,scissors? nah i doubt it,i probably need just a condition that says if choice === "Rock" then action etc</li> 
    <br>
    <li>so i know there exist a math.random that give a random number,i need some kind of choice.random will see, so a function with that</li>
    <br>
    <li>need condition so IF condition,ex: if Computer rock and player paper then player win,else if computer paper and player rock then computer win etc...</li>
    <li>maybe add 2 count,one for when i win,1 for when the computer wins,increment with each win and using a while loop exit the game once any reach 3 ?</li>
  </ul>
